# Advent of code 2022

![](images/image.png)

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!

Advent of Code is a fun and challenging way to get into coding and problem-solving, and I've been enjoying it for a few years now. In this repo, you'll find all of my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge.

I'll be adding to this repo as the challenges are released, so feel free to check back and see how I'm doing. I can't guarantee that my solutions will be the most efficient or elegant, but they'll get the job done (eventually).

Happy coding and happy holidays!
